## convert settings
kit: "sigprep" ## sigprep/kintelligence 
types: "i" ## choices are "all", "i" (identity SNPs only), "p" (phenotype only), "a" (ancestry only) or any combination
nofilter: False ## True/False if no filtering is desired; if False, will remove any allele designated as Not Typed

## format settings
strand: "forward" ## forward/uas; indicates which oritentation to report the alleles for the ForenSeq SNPs; uas indicates the orientation as reported by the UAS or the forward strand
